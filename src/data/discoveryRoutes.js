Fall foliage season turns this into one of the most photographed roads in America, but even in summer the elevation changes and flowing curves make it a must-drive.',

The notch section squeezes down to barely one and a half lanes between sheer rock walls, with hairpin turns that'll have you in second gear and grinning. Giant boulders loom overhead as you thread through this narrow mountain pass beneath Mount Mansfield. It's seasonal, technical, and absolutely unforgettable.",
